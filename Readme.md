### Morning

- ~~Draw.io~~
- **Basic Server with Express.js**: We'll build Express.js servers with CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations. We'll code from scratch and test the functionality using Postman.
  - [Summary](./material/crud.md)
  - [Activity 1: Array Manipulation](./material/crud-activity.md)
  - [Activity 2](./material/crud-activity2.md)

### Afternoon:

- **Postman**: You'll receive the code for two servers and learn how to interact with them using the four main `CRUD` operations: `create`, `read`, `update`, and `delete`. We'll use Postman to perform these operations. The code for the servers will be discussed in detail on Wednesday.
